# filetransfer
Internet file transfer between different branches in different location, written in Java

This program was written in 2001 when I worked for contract project for a internet file storage company. It used Socket API,Swing,JDBC,ect.

These codes were written more than 13 years ago. Some of the files are currently missing. So it can't be compiled and run now. 

I am busy now and don't have the time to find the missing files. I wish that those missing files can be found in the future!
